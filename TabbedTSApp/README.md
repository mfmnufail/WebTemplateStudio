2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    yarn react-native link
    yarn windows
    ```
    
    *Note*: ```yarn windows``` it´s the same as running: ```npx react-native run-windows```
3. The tool will deploy the application on your machine, run it and launch the packager

**Option 2**
1. Open the `windows` folder in File Explorer.

### Run the sample on iOS
[Go to React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
Once you have the repo and the environment setup, you will just need to run:
```bash
    yarn react-native link
    yarn ios
```

*Note*: If navigation icons doesn´t display correctly you may need to go to ```ios``` folder and run ```pod install```

### Run the sample on Android
[Go to React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
As a summary it should just work if after configuring your PC you just run:
```bash
    yarn react-native link
    yarn android
```

*Note*: ```yarn android``` it´s the same as running: ```npx react-native run-android```
